# Movie App
### Description
This is just 2 screens. on pressing the first item from the home screen navigates you to the detail screen.
***Note*** The UI can also be beautified using the selectors.

### Feedback
The complexity level was easy, but the main thing that took long time to understand was the API strucuture(watchmode api) and how to 
pass data to the detail screen i.e. only the required data(movie detail) or the view model as a whole.

I have used the Koin for dependency injection and the choice of this is due to the new technology and the runtime dependency provider.

Tey to improve it more, make it advanced application in the by integrating the webview and the videos availability.
