# Vijayi WFH Assignment
### Description
This is just 2 screens. on pressing the first item from the home screen navigates you to the detail screen.
***Note*** The UI can also be beautified using the selectors.

### Feedback
It was nice project for me but, I will work on it more to beautify it.
The complexity level was Moderate, but the main thing that took long time to understand was the API strucuture(watchmode api) and how to 
pass data to the detail screen i.e. only the required data(movie detail) or the view model as a whole.

I have used the Koin for dependency injection and the choice of this is due to the new technology and the runtime dependency provider.

My overall experience was OK. 
But I need to improve it more, I will make it advanced application in the coming future by integrating the webview and the videos availability.
